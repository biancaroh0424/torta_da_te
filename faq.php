                Our cakes are generally loved for the abundance of fresh cream. Elaborate decoration with cream is also a feature of celebration cakes and this is in addition, on top and sides of our cakes. Please use your discretion in serving the desired amount of cream to sponge. Darkly coloured cream will taste bitter and is best not served at all.
